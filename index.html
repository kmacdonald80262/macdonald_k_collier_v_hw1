	<p>I was born December 19,1996 in Ancaster, Ontario. I have a twin sister named Erin, and an older sister named Maggie. I have always loved art and my mediumnis painting and indian ink. I always wanted to do something design related; was looking into graphic design but have chosen interactive media design instead as I wanted to learn coding and be more of an asset to the design industry.</p>

	I am an avid athlete as well loving all forms of sport and working out. I am half irish and scottish and have visited Ireland several times. I also hope to have my art shown in the Art Gallery of Hamilton soon!
