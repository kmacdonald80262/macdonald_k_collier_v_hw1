	<p>	My name is Victoria. I am nineteen years old and I was born here in London. I was raised by my single mother alongside my sister Natalie. <br>Natalie and I are five years apart, so naturally we fought a lot growing up. However, now we are best friends. Last year, I attened Western <br>University in the MIT program. In theory, this program was supposed to be what I enjoyed however, I later realized i was most passionate <br>about hands on design which ultimately led me here!</p>

	<p> When I was only five, my mom and dad filed for divorce. I don't say this for pity, I say this because it has made me into the person I am today. <br>Without the divorce, I would not be so close to my mother and my sister. Our relationship is so unique because the three of us are more like best <br>friends. The reason I have made it this far in life is because of the relationship I have with the two of them. Most of my creativity has stemmed <br>from unfortunate events in my life, like a lot of artists. Creativity is such an important aspect in my life. The first thing I was ever 'talented' at was <br>playing the clarinet. My love for music then turned into visual art, videography and photography.</p>

	<p> Now that I have addressed the events that have shaped me, I can now tell you about my passions. My first passion would be travel. As of right<br>now, I have not done a ton of travelling because of school, however I plan on changing that. My goal is to visit every continent with the exception <br>of Antartica. My two favorite places that I have been to so far have been New York City, London, England and Oxford, England. I believe travel <br>can teach people lessons that nothing else can. To understand the world, you have to explore it.</p>
